Wijdan is a talented developer and quick learner.  She is a strong teammate and would often teach other students in the classroom if they were confused about a technical topic.  Wijdan's projects went above and beyond our project requirements by researching and implementing technologies that we did not teach.  Wijdan's problem solving and programming skills along with her communication and leadership skills make Wijdan a stellar technical team member.  I give her my highest recommendation and can not wait to see what she does next!",
